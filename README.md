# Evolution-engine
# Description
The evolution engine (may change the name) is a program that allows you to watch artificial organisms inside of your browser. 

## Organism
Organisms are made up of cells. Cells have are connected via bones to form a body. The organism can mutate its brain to more efficiently collect food pellets.

## Cells
Cells take some energy and also have special qualities dependent on its type.

## Controls
You can move the camera by dragging the mouse and scrolling.
More controlls are avalible on the controls folder under the Main folder in the Main ui tab.

## Evolution
Organisms mutate their brain as they live, but mutate their bones and cells on birth. 


# Inspirtaion 
This project was the result of me watching a lot of videos on artificial life and I took heavy inspiration from the following projects.

- [Space Simulation Toolkit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppQxZ3ZC0r4&t=3s&ab_channel=SpaceSimulationToolkit)
